# JSBulkObfuscator
This Website / Webserver Obfuscates your Projects within seconds!

Just upload your whole WebProject in a .zip format and I will make it unreadable!

Only .js files will get obfuscated! So place all your scripts in a .js file instead of in HTML!

Once you upload your File, it will be processed instantly! It takes quite some time so be patient!
There are no processing queues, so if many people use it simultanousely it will definitely be slower / lag.

After the file was sent back, it will get deleted from the Server.

Feel free to contribute to this.

Special thanks to obfuscator.io for providing me the general Obfuscation part.
